	 * [language](#language), [priceInCurrency](#price-in-currency), [priceValidInTime](#price-valid-in-time),
	 * [with hierarchy](#within-hierarchy).
	 *
	 * These constraints should react to the settings defined by the end user and must be isolated from the base filter so
	 * that [facetSummary](#facet-summary) logic can distinguish base filtering constraint for a facet summary computation.
	 * Facet summary must define so-called baseline count - i.e. count of the entities that match system constraints but no
	 * optional constraints defined by the user has been applied yet on them. This baseline is also used
	 * for [facet statistics](#facet-statistics) computation.
	 *
	 * This constraint might be used even without [facetSummary](#facet-summary) - when the result facet counts are not
	 * required but still we want the facets use for filtering.
	 *
	 * Only single `userFilter` constraint can be used in the query.
	 *
	 * Example:
	 *
	 * ```
	 * userFilter(
	 * greaterThanEq('memory', 8),
	 * priceBetween(150.25, 220.0),
	 * facet('parameter', 4, 15)
	 * )
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Even more complex queries are supported (although it is hard to make up some real life example for such):
	 *
	 * ```
	 * filterBy(
	 * and(
	 * or(
	 * referenceHavingAttribute('CATEGORY', eq(code, 'abc')),
	 * referenceHavingAttribute('STOCK', eq(market, 'asia')),
	 * ),
	 * eq(visibility, true),
	 * userFilter(
	 * or(
	 * and(
	 * greaterThanEq('memory', 8),
	 * priceBetween(150.25, 220.0)
	 * ),
	 * and(
	 * greaterThanEq('memory', 16),
	 * priceBetween(800.0, 1600.0)
	 * ),

	 * facet('parameter', 4, 15)
	 * )

	 * ),
	 * require(
	 * facetGroupDisjunction('parameterType', 4),
	 * negatedFacets('parameterType', 8),
	 * )
	 *
	 * ```
	 *
	 * User filter envelopes the part of the query that is affected by user selection and that is optional. All constraints
	 * outside user filter are considered mandatory and must never be altered by [facet summary](#facet-summary) computational
	 * logic.
	 *
	 * Base count of the facets are computed for query having `userFilter` container contents stripped off. The "what-if"
	 * counts requested by [impact argument](#facet-summary) are computed from the query including `userFilter` creating
	 * multiple sub-queries checking the result for each additional facet selection.
	 *
	 * [Facet](#facet) filtering constraints must be direct children of the `userFilter` container. Their relationship is by
	 * default as follows: facets of the same type within same group are combined by conjunction (OR), facets of different
	 * types / groups are combined by disjunction (AND). This default behaviour can be controlled exactly by using any of
	 * following require constraints:
	 *
	 * - [facet groups conjunction](#facet-groups-conjunction) - changes relationship between facets in the same group
	 * - [facet groups disjunction](#facet-groups-disjunction) - changes relationship between facet groups
	 *
	 * All constraints placed directly inside `userFilter` are combined with by conjunction (AND). Other than `facet` filtering
	 * constraints (as seen in example) may represent user conditions in non-faceted inputs, such as interval inputs.
	 *
	 * ***Note:** this constraint might be a subject to change and affects advanced searching queries such as exclusion facet
	 * groups (i.e. facet in group are not represented as multi-select/checkboxes but as exlusive select/radio) or conditional
	 * filters (which can be used to apply a certain filter only if it would produce non-empty result, this is good for
	 * "sticky" filters).*

	 * Function returns true if entity has at least one price in any of specified price lists. This function is also affected by
	 * [priceInCurrency](#price-in-currency) function that limits the examined prices as well. The order of the price lists
	 * passed in the argument is crucial, because it defines the priority of the price lists. Let's have a product with
	 * following prices:
	 *
	 * | priceList       | currency | priceWithVat |
	 * |-----------------|----------|--------------|
	 * | basic           | EUR      | 999.99       |
	 * | registered_user | EUR      | 979.00       |

	 * | b2b_discount    | EUR      | 869.00       |
	 *

	 * priceInPriceLists('basic', 'b2b_discount'),
	 * priceBetween(800.0, 900.0)
	 * )`
	 *
	 * The product will not be found - because query engine will use first defined price for the price lists in defined order.
	 * It's in our case the price `999.99`, which is not in the defined price interval 800 ‚Ç¨ - 900 ‚Ç¨. If the price lists in
	 * arguments gets switched to `priceInPriceLists('b2b_discount', 'basic')`, the product will be returned, because the first
	 * price is now from `b2b_discount` price list - 869 ‚Ç¨ and this price is within defined interval.
	 *
	 * This constraint affect also the prices accessible in returned entities. By default, (unless [prices](#prices) requirement
	 * has ALL mode used), returned entities will contain only prices from specified price lists. In other words if entity has
	 * two prices - one from price list `1` and second from price list `2` and `priceInPriceLists(1)` is used in the query

	 * price it will never be returned when {@link PriceInPriceLists} constraint or any other price constraint is used in the
	 * query. Non-sellable prices behaves like they don't exist. These non-sellable prices still remain accessible for reading
	 * on fetched entity in case the product is found by sellable price satisfying the filter. If you have specific price list
	 * reserved for non-sellable prices you may still use it in {@link PriceInPriceLists} constraint. It won't affect the set

	 * This `withinHierarchy` constraint accepts [Serializable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html)
	 * entity type in first argument, primary key of [Integer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html)
	 * type of entity with [hierarchical placement](../model/entity_model.md#hierarchical-placement) in second argument. There
	 * are also optional third and fourth arguments - see optional arguments {@link DirectRelation}, {@link ExcludingRoot}
	 * and {@link Excluding}.
	 *
	 * Constraint can also have only one numeric argument representing primary key of [Integer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html)
	 * the very same entity type in case this entity has [hierarchical placement](../model/entity_model.md#hierarchical-placement)
	 * defined. This format of the constraint may be used for example for returning category sub-tree (where we want to return
	 * category entities and also constraint them by their own hierarchy placement).
	 *
	 * Function returns true if entity has at least one [reference](../model/entity_model.md#references) that relates to specified entity
	 * type and entity either directly or relates to any other entity of the same type with [hierarchical placement](../model/entity_model.md#hierarchical-placement)
	 * subordinate to the directly related entity placement (in other words is present in its sub-tree).
	 *
	 * Let's have following hierarchical tree of categories (primary keys are in brackets):
	 *
	 * - TV (1)
	 * - Crt (2)
	 * - LCD (3)
	 * - big (4)
	 * - small (5)
	 * - Plasma (6)
	 * - Fridges (7)
	 *
	 * When constraint `withinHierarchy('category', 1)` is used in a query targeting product entities only products that
	 * relates directly to categories: `TV`, `Crt`, `LCD`, `big`, `small` and `Plasma` will be returned. Products in `Fridges`
	 * will be omitted because they are not in a sub-tree of `TV` hierarchy.
	 *
	 * Only single `withinHierarchy` constraint can be used in the query.
	 *
	 * Example:
	 *
	 * ```
	 * withinHierarchy('category', 4)
	 * ```
	 *
	 * If you want to constraint the entity that you're querying on you can also omit entity type specification. See example:
	 *
	 * ```
	 * query(
	 * entities('CATEGORY'),
	 * filterBy(
	 * withinHierarchy(5)
	 * )
	 * )
	 * ```
	 *
	 * This query will return all categories that belong to the sub-tree of category with primary key equal to 5.
	 *
	 * If you want to list all entities from the root level you need to use different constraint - `withinRootHierarchy` that
	 * has the same notation but doesn't specify the id of the root level entity:
	 *
	 * ```
	 * query(
	 * entities('CATEGORY'),
	 * filterBy(
	 * withinRootHierarchy()
	 * )
	 * )
	 * ```
	 *
	 * This query will return all categories within `CATEGORY` entity.
	 *
	 * You may use this constraint to list entities that refers to the hierarchical entities:
	 *
	 * ```
	 * query(
	 * entities('PRODUCT'),
	 * filterBy(
	 * withinRootHierarchy('CATEGORY')
	 * )
	 * )
	 * ```
	 *
	 * This query returns all products that are attached to any category. Although, this query doesn't make much sense it starts
	 * to be useful when combined with additional inner constraints described in following paragraphs.
	 *
	 * You can use additional sub constraints in `withinHierarchy` constraint: {@link DirectRelation}, {@link ExcludingRoot}
	 * and {@link Excluding}

	 * <pre>
	 * Electronics -> 1789
