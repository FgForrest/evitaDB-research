/**
 * This `priceBetween` constraint accepts two {@link BigDecimal} arguments that represents lower and higher price
 * bounds (inclusive).
 *
 * Function returns true if entity has sellable price in most prioritized price list according to {@link PriceInPriceLists}
 * constraint greater than or equal to passed lower bound and lesser than or equal to passed higher bound. This function
 * is also affected by other price related constraints such as {@link PriceInCurrency} functions that limits the examined
 * prices as well.
 *
 * Most prioritized price term relates to [price computation algorithm](price_computation.md) described in special article.
 *
 * By default, price with VAT is used for filtering, you can change this by using {@link UseOfPrice} require constraint.
 * Non-sellable prices doesn't participate in the filtering at all.
 *
 * Only single `priceBetween` constraint can be used in the query.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * priceBetween(150.25, 220.0)
 * ```
