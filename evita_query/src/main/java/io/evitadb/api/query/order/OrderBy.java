/**
 * This `orderBy` is container for ordering. It is mandatory container when any ordering is to be used. Ordering
 * process is as follows:
 *
 * - first ordering evaluated, entities missing requested attribute value are excluded to intermediate bucket
 * - next ordering is evaluated using entities present in an intermediate bucket, entities missing requested attribute
 *   are excluded to new intermediate bucket
 * - second step is repeated until all orderings are processed
 * - content of the last intermediate bucket is appended to the result ordered by the primary key in ascending order
 *
 * Entities with same (equal) values must not be subject to secondary ordering rules and may be sorted randomly within
 * the scope of entities with the same value (this is subject to change, currently this behaviour differs from the one
 * used by relational databases - but might be more performant).
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * orderBy(
 *     ascending('code'),
 *     ascending('create'),
 *     priceDescending()
 * )
 * ```
