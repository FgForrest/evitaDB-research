/**
 * This `priceHistogram` requirement usage triggers computing and adding an object to the result index. It has single
 * argument that states the number of histogram buckets (columns) that can be safely visualized to the user. Usually
 * there is fixed size area dedicated to the histogram visualisation and there is no sense to return histogram with
 * so many buckets (columns) that wouldn't be possible to render. For example - if there is 200px size for the histogram
 * and we want to dedicate 10px for one column, it's wise to ask for 20 buckets.
 *
 * When this requirement is used an additional object {@link io.evitadb.api.io.extraResult.Histogram} is stored to the result.
 * Histogram contains statistics on price layout in the query result.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * priceHistogram(20)
 * ```
