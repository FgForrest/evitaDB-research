/**
 * This `facet` constraint accepts [Serializable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html)
 * entity type in first argument and one or more
 * additional [Integer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html)
 * arguments that represents [facets](../model/entity_model.md#facets) that entity is required to have in order to match
 * this constraint.
 *
 * Function returns true if entity has a facet for specified entity type and matches passed primary keys in additional
 * arguments. By matching we mean, that entity has to have any of its facet (with particular type) primary keys equal to at
 * least one primary key specified in additional arguments.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * query(
 * entities('product'),
 * filterBy(
 * userFilter(
 * facet('category', 4, 5),
 * facet('group', 7, 13)
 * )
 * )
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * Constraint may be used only in [user filter](#user-filter) container. By default, facets of the same type within same
 * group are combined by conjunction (OR), facets of different types / groups are combined by disjunction (AND). This
 * default behaviour can be controlled exactly by using any of following require constraints:
 *
 * - [facet groups conjunction](#facet-groups-conjunction) - changes relationship between facets in the same group
 * - [facet groups disjunction](#facet-groups-disjunction) - changes relationship between facet groups
 *
 * ***Note:** you may ask why facet relation is specified by [require](#require) and not directly part of
 * the [filter](#filter)
 * body. The reason is simple - facet relation in certain group is usually specified system-wide and doesn't change in time
 * frequently. This means that it could be easily cached and passing this information in an extra require simplifies query
 * construction process.*
 *
 * *Another reason is that we need to know relationships among facet groups even for types/groups that hasn't yet been
 * selected by the user in order to be able to compute [facet summary](#facet-summary) output.*
