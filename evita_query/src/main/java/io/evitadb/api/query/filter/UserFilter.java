/**
 * This `userFilter` is a container constraint that could contain any constraints
 * except [priceInPriceLists](#price-in-price-lists),
 * [language](#language), [priceInCurrency](#price-in-currency), [priceValidInTime](#price-valid-in-time),
 * [with hierarchy](#within-hierarchy).
 *
 * These constraints should react to the settings defined by the end user and must be isolated from the base filter so
 * that [facetSummary](#facet-summary) logic can distinguish base filtering constraint for a facet summary computation.
 * Facet summary must define so-called baseline count - i.e. count of the entities that match system constraints but no
 * optional constraints defined by the user has been applied yet on them. This baseline is also used
 * for [facet statistics](#facet-statistics) computation.
 *
 * This constraint might be used even without [facetSummary](#facet-summary) - when the result facet counts are not
 * required but still we want the facets use for filtering.
 *
 * Only single `userFilter` constraint can be used in the query.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * userFilter(
 * greaterThanEq('memory', 8),
 * priceBetween(150.25, 220.0),
 * facet('parameter', 4, 15)
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * Even more complex queries are supported (although it is hard to make up some real life example for such):
 *
 * ```
 * filterBy(
 * and(
 * or(
 * referenceHavingAttribute('CATEGORY', eq(code, 'abc')),
 * referenceHavingAttribute('STOCK', eq(market, 'asia')),
 * ),
 * eq(visibility, true),
 * userFilter(
 * or(
 * and(
 * greaterThanEq('memory', 8),
 * priceBetween(150.25, 220.0)
 * ),
 * and(
 * greaterThanEq('memory', 16),
 * priceBetween(800.0, 1600.0)
 * ),
 * ),
 * facet('parameter', 4, 15)
 * )
 * )
 * ),
 * require(
 * facetGroupDisjunction('parameterType', 4),
 * negatedFacets('parameterType', 8),
 * )
 *
 * ```
 *
 * User filter envelopes the part of the query that is affected by user selection and that is optional. All constraints
 * outside user filter are considered mandatory and must never be altered by [facet summary](#facet-summary) computational
 * logic.
 *
 * Base count of the facets are computed for query having `userFilter` container contents stripped off. The "what-if"
 * counts requested by [impact argument](#facet-summary) are computed from the query including `userFilter` creating
 * multiple sub-queries checking the result for each additional facet selection.
 *
 * [Facet](#facet) filtering constraints must be direct children of the `userFilter` container. Their relationship is by
 * default as follows: facets of the same type within same group are combined by conjunction (OR), facets of different
 * types / groups are combined by disjunction (AND). This default behaviour can be controlled exactly by using any of
 * following require constraints:
 *
 * - [facet groups conjunction](#facet-groups-conjunction) - changes relationship between facets in the same group
 * - [facet groups disjunction](#facet-groups-disjunction) - changes relationship between facet groups
 *
 * All constraints placed directly inside `userFilter` are combined with by conjunction (AND). Other than `facet` filtering
 * constraints (as seen in example) may represent user conditions in non-faceted inputs, such as interval inputs.
 *
 * ***Note:** this constraint might be a subject to change and affects advanced searching queries such as exclusion facet
 * groups (i.e. facet in group are not represented as multi-select/checkboxes but as exlusive select/radio) or conditional
 * filters (which can be used to apply a certain filter only if it would produce non-empty result, this is good for
 * "sticky" filters).*
