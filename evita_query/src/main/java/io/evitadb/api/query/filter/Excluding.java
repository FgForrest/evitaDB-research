/**
 * If you use {@link ExcludingRoot} sub-constraint in {@link WithinHierarchy} parent, you can specify one or more
 * Integer primary keys of the underlying entities which hierarchical subtree should be excluded from examination.
 *
 * Exclusion arguments allows excluding certain parts of the hierarchy tree from examination. This feature is used in
 * environments where certain sub-trees can be made "invisible" and should not be accessible to users, although they are
 * still part of the database.
 *
 * Let's have following hierarchical tree of categories (primary keys are in brackets):
 *
 * - TV (1)
 *     - Crt (2)
 *     - LCD (3)
 *         - big (4)
 *         - small (5)
 *     - Plasma (6)
 * - Fridges (7)
 *
 * When constraint `withinHierarchy('category', 1, excluding(3))` is used in a query targeting product entities,
 * only products that relate directly to categories: `TV`, `Crt` and `Plasma` will be returned. Products in `Fridges` will
 * be omitted because they are not in a sub-tree of `TV` hierarchy and products in `LCD` sub-tree will be omitted because
 * they're part of the excluded sub-trees.
