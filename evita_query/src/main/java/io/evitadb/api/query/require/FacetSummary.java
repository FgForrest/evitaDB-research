/**
 * This `facetSummary` requirement usage triggers computing and adding an object to the result index. The object is
 * quite complex but allows rendering entire facet listing to e-commerce users. It contains information about all
 * facets present in current hierarchy view along with count of requested entities that have those facets assigned.
 *
 * Facet summary respects current query filtering constraints excluding the conditions inside {@link UserFilter}
 * container constraint.
 *
 * When this requirement is used an additional object {@link io.evitadb.api.io.extraResult.FacetSummary} is stored to result.
 *
 * Optionally accepts single enum argument:
 *
 * - COUNT: only counts of facets will be computed
 * - IMPACT: counts and selection impact for non-selected facets will be computed
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * facetSummary()
 * facetSummary(COUNT) //same as previous row - default
 * facetSummary(IMPACT)
 * ```
