/**
 * This `language` is constraint accepts single {@link Locale} argument.
 *
 * Function returns true if entity has at least one localized attribute or associated data that  targets specified locale.
 *
 * If require part of the query doesn't contain {@link io.evitadb.api.query.require.DataInLanguage} requirement that
 * would specify the requested data localization, this filtering constraint implicitly sets requirement to the passed
 * language argument. In other words if entity has two localizations: `en-US` and `cs-CZ` and `language('cs-CZ')` is
 * used in query, returned entity would have only Czech localization of attributes and associated data fetched along
 * with it (and also attributes that are locale agnostic).
 *
 * If query contains no language constraint filtering logic is applied only on "global" (i.e. language agnostic)
 * attributes.
 *
 * Only single `language` constraint can be used in the query.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * language('en-US')
 * ```
