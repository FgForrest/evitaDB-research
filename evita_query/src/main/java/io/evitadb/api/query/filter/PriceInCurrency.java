/**
 * This `priceInCurrency` is constraint accepts single {@link String}
 * argument that represents [currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) in ISO 4217 code or direct {@link Currency}
 * instance.
 *
 * Function returns true if entity has at least one price with specified currency. This function is also affected by
 * {@link PriceInPriceLists} function that limits the examined prices as well. When this constraint
 * is used in the query returned entities will contain only prices matching specified locale. In other words if entity has
 * two prices: USD and CZK and `priceInCurrency('CZK')` is used in query returned entity would have only Czech crown prices
 * fetched along with it.
 *
 * Only single `priceInCurrency` constraint can be used in the query. Constraint must be defined when other price related
 * constraints are used in the query.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * priceInCurrency('USD')
 * ```
