/**
 * This is the definition object for {@link AssociatedData} that is stored along with
 * {@link Entity}. Definition objects allow to describe the structure of the entity type so that
 * in any time everyone can consult complete structure of the entity type. Definition object is similar to Java reflection
 * process where you can also at any moment see which fields and methods are available for the class.
 *
 * Associated data carry additional data entries that are never used for filtering / sorting but may be needed to be fetched
 * along with entity in order to present data to the target consumer (i.e. user / API / bot). Associated data may be stored
 * in slower storage and may contain wide range of data types - from small ones (i.e. numbers, strings, dates) up to large
 * binary arrays representing entire files (i.e. pictures, documents).
