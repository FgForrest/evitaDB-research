/**
 * Associated data {@link Mutation} allows to execute mutation operations on {@link AssociatedData} of the {@link Entity}
 * object. Each associated data change is increases {@link AssociatedDataValue#getVersion()} by one, associated data removal only sets
 * tombstone flag on a associated data value and doesn't really remove it. Possible removal will be taken care of during
 * compaction process, leaving associatedDatas in place allows to see last assigned value to the associated data and also consult
 * last version of the associated data.
 *
 * These traits should help to manage concurrent transactional process as updates to the same entity could be executed
 * safely and concurrently as long as associated data modification doesn't overlap. Some mutations may also overcome same
 * associated data concurrent modification if it's safely additive (i.e. incrementation / decrementation and so on).
 *
 * Exact mutations also allows engine implementation to safely update only those indexes that the change really affects
 * and doesn't require additional analysis.
