/**
 * Entities may be organized in hierarchical fashion. That means that entity may refer to single parent entity and may be
 * referred by multiple child entities. Hierarchy is always composed of entities of same type.
 * Each entity must be part of at most single hierarchy (tree).
 * Hierarchy can limit returned entities by using filtering constraints {@link WithinHierarchy}. It's also used for
 * computation of extra data - such as {@link Parents}. It can also invert type of returned entities in case requirement
 * {@link HierarchyStatistics} is used.
