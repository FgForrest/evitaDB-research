/**
 * Implementations of this interface represents parts of the {@link io.evitadb.api.data.structure.Entity} object that
 * are stored as separated records on the disk. Separating {@link io.evitadb.api.data.structure.Entity} data into several
 * parts allows optimization of the data regarding usual reading scenarios. Separating entity data into the parts should
 * take into an account following prospectives:
 *
 * - what data are usually read together
 * - the data size
 * - bigger data chunks will mean a lot of data will not be used after deserialization due to query constraints
 * - many tiny data chunks will mean more seeks in the data file and each data chunk is accompanied by a cost
 * of dead weight of {@link StorageRecord#OVERHEAD_SIZE}
